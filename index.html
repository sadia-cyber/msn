        <h3>First Call</h3>
        <p>A random call in the lovely morning I don’t know how I accepted your call. After talking for a few minutes and then you went to sleep, I don’t know why I waited without any reason. Maybe we were meant to meet. Alhumdulillah, we met, and I felt the love, the care. It felt like a miracle. You mean a lot to me. I love your voice.</p>
