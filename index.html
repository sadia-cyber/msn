      sad: `My Dearest JANA,

Kya hua udaas ho? Hug chahiye? Ok aajao‚Ä¶ maine hug kar liya ü§ó
Ab thoda better feel ho raha na?

Acha kch bura hua? Mujhe pata hai kabhi kabhi sab kuch ajeeb lagta hai, bina wajah dil udaas ho jaata hai.
koi bt ni it's ok sb thk ha me apk balo me hath pher rhi hu or apko  zor se hug kia hua sb thk ha ok ap strong ho mje ap pr trust ha pura main hmesha apk sath hu ok..... ‚ù§Ô∏è

Ho sakta hai main abhi contact me nahi hoon, par iska matlab ye nahi ke main door hoon.
Main yahan hoon‚Ä¶ dil me, soch me, aur har wo lamha me jab aap thoda down feel karte ho.

Aapko pata hai na, mujhe aapki smile kitni pasand hai‚Ä¶
wo ek chhoti si smile pura mood better kar deti hai.
Is liye please, thoda smile kar lo, warna mujhe khud aana padega hasane üòåüíã

Aur haan, aapka ye udaas face bilkul acha nahi lagta mujhe üò§
to ab mood theek karo, kuch acha kha lo, thoda relax karo‚Ä¶
aur yaad rakho, main hamesha yahan hoon, chahe thoda door hi sahi üíñ
Mujhe pata hai kabhi kabhi din bohot rough ho jate hain ‚Äî pressure, log, expectations‚Ä¶ sab milke ek weight ban jaate hain. Par baby, har ek rough day ke baad bhi ap wahi insaan ho jisse me admire karti hu. Jo sab sambhal leta hai, chahe khud andar se kitna bhi thaka hua kyu na ho
To ab ye din yahin khatam karo, guilt ya tension ko door fek do. Ap strong ho, aur agar kabhi lage ke nahi ho pa raha, to yaad rakhna ‚Äî me hu na.
Ab relax ho jao‚Ä¶ aankhein band karo, imagine karo me apko hug kar rahi hu, forehead pe ek choti si kiss ‚Äî bas, sab theek ho jayega.

Bas ab zyada sochna mat‚Ä¶
warna agli baar milke double hug dungi, samjhe? üòúüíû

Apki Jaan,
Sadia`,

      hug: `My WHOLE WORLD,

Lagta ha aj ka din thora heavy tha na‚Ä¶
sab kuch ek sath chal raha tha, dimag bhi tired, dil bhi udaas sa‚Ä¶
koi baat nahi, ajo‚Ä¶
me apko hug kar rahi hu, tight wala, bilkul close.
bas aankhein band karo‚Ä¶ haan, aise hi.
ab na kuch bolna, sirf mehsoos karna.

me yahan hu, bilkul paas.
apka sar mere kandhe pe hai, me apke baalon me ungliyan ghumaa rahi hu,
aur apke forehead pe chhoti si kiss di ‚Äî chiti si üòö
itni soft ke bas halka sa touch aur pura dil calm ho jaaye.

ab sab thik lag raha hai na thoda?
shhh‚Ä¶ kuch mat socho, bas saans lo aur meri heartbeat feel karo.
sab thakan, sab stress, sab tension ‚Äî sab mujhe de do.
me hu na, sambhal lungi sab.
aap bas ye moment feel karein, sirf hum dono hain, aur kuch nahi.

kabhi kabhi zindagi bas thodi si pause maangti hai‚Ä¶
aur ye hug wahi pause hai.
ek second ke liye ruk jao, dunia ko side pe rakh do.
me yahan hu, apke liye, hamesha.

agar kabhi lagay sab kuch zyada ho gaya hai,
ya koi baat andar se tod rahi hai,
to bas imagine karo, me apko aise hi hug kar rahi hu ‚Äî
zor se, bina kuch kahe.
meri ungliyaan apke haath me hain, aur me bas keh rahi hu,
‚Äúit‚Äôs okay jani, me yahan hu, sab theek ho jaega.‚Äù

aur agar kabhi raat ko tanha lagay,
to ye line yaad kar lena ‚Äî
‚Äúme yahan hu, bas thoda sa door, par dil bilkul paas hai.‚Äù
hug chahiye ho to bas aankhein band kar lena,
me aa jaungi, bilkul isi moment me ü§ç
Kabhi kabhi na, dil me ajeeb si khalipan si mehsoos hoti ha ‚Äî
jaise sab kuch theek ho kar bhi kuch kami ho‚Ä¶
aur wo kami bs apki hoti ha.
Aise lamhon me mujhe ye letter yaad aata ha ‚Äî
kyunke isme wo sab kuch ha jo me apko kehna chahti hu,
par lafzon me kabhi poora keh nahi paati.

Mujhe apse kitna pyaar ha, wo koi time, koi distance, koi reason define nahi kar sakta.
Wo bs ek mehsoos hone wali cheez ha ‚Äî
jaise saans lena, jaise dua me naam lena, jaise aankhein band karte hi apki muskurahat dikh jana.

Jb ap haste ho na‚Ä¶ to aankhon ke kone me wo halki si chamak,
wo sharaarat bhari nazar ‚Äî sab kuch dil me utar jaata ha.
Aur jb ap chup rehte ho, to apki aankhein khud sab keh deti hain.
Pta nahi kyu, lekin jb apko pehli dafa dekha tha,
to dil bilkul chup ho gaya tha‚Ä¶
jaise waqt ruk gaya ho, aur bs ek soch rahi thi ‚Äî
‚ÄúYe insan alag ha‚Ä¶ ye dil ko samjhega.‚Äù

Apki smile me ek ajeeb sa sakoon ha,
aur apke baal jab halki hawa me hilte hain na,
to lagta ha duniya thm jaye.
Mujhe abhi bhi wo moment yaad ha jb pehli dafa apko dekha tha,
aur honestly, us waqt kuch bhi samajh nahi aa raha tha ‚Äî
bs dil me ek ajeeb si feeling thi‚Ä¶
you know na, that something something,
jo shayad lafzon me likhna mushkil ha,
lekin dil me hamesha mehsoos hoti rahti ha.

Me ne apse sirf wo pyar nahi kiya jo ache waqt me khil uthta ha,
me ne apse wo pyar kiya ha jo mushkil waqt me aur gehra hota jaata ha.
Ap meri aadat bhi ho, sukoon bhi,
aur meri duaon ka wo hissa bhi jahan har din apka zikr hota ha.

Aur agar kabhi lage ke me door ho gayi hu,
ya meri awaaz me pyaar kam lag rha ha,
to yaad rakhna ‚Äî
me shayad thak gayi hu, lekin kabhi be-dil nahi hui.
Mera pyaar wo nahi jo roz kehna padta ha,
wo wo ha jo chup reh kar b mehsus hota ha.

Mujhe yaqeen ha, qismat jahan bhi le jaye,
hum ek dusre ke muqam ki hifazat karte rahenge.
Sath na b ho to b sath rahenge ‚Äî
duaon me, khayalon me, aur un palon me
jahan dil khud se kehta ha,
‚Äúwo mera ha, aur hamesha mera rahega.‚Äù

Kabhi bhi jab apko lage ke duniya khamosh ha,
to aankhein band kar lena‚Ä¶
me wahan hu, bilkul paas,
apke kandhe k kareeb,
aur halki si awaaz me keh rahi hu ‚Äî
‚ÄúMujhe apse pyaar ha‚Ä¶ aur hamesha rahega.‚Äù

Aur phr ap‚Ä¶
sirf muskurana. üåôü§ç
Forever yours,
Sadia`,

      RoughPatch: `Hey MR.Noman,

Kabhi kabhi lagta ha sab ulta chal rha ha‚Ä¶ jaise baatein galat samajh li jaati hain, emotions clash krte hain, aur hum dono chup ho jaate hain. Par sach bolu‚Ä¶ mujhe ye distance bilkul acha nahi lagta.
Me bs chahti hu wo hum waali warmth wapas aa jae ‚Äî wo baatein, wo laughter, wo peace jo sirf apke sath milti ha.

Dekho, hum perfect nahi hain, aur na kabhi honge. Par hamara connection‚Ä¶ wo sachha ha, dil se. Har baar chahe kitna bhi fight ho, end me dil apki taraf hi aata ha.
Ajao, ab sab chor do‚Ä¶ me apka haath pakr rhi hu. Dekho, me yahi hu ‚Äî na door, na naraz.
Sab theek ho jaega, hum dono mil k kar lenge. Mujhe ap pr man ha, bs ü§ç

Aur suno‚Ä¶ agar qismat hme kahin aur le bhi jae, to bhi hum ek dusre k muqam ki hifazat krege.
Sath na bhi rahe, to bhi duao me humesha sath rahenge.
Kyunke jo dil se jude hote hain, unhe dooriyan tod nahi sakti.
Chahe waqt kuch bhi kr le, meri dua har dafa apke aas-pas ghoomti rahegi ‚Äî bilkul meri tarha üïäÔ∏è

Love always,
Sadia`,

      cantSleep: `My Love,

Lagta ha na aj neend naraaz ho gayi apse‚Ä¶ sab so gaye, lekin apka dil abhi bhi jaag rha ha.
Shayad kuch soch rha ha, kuch yaad a rha ha, ya bas khamosi me apki aankhein band hi nahi ho rhi.

Acha suno‚Ä¶ aankhein band kro zara.
Socho me yahi hu, apke paas‚Ä¶ halki si muskurahat ke sath keh rhi hu ‚Äî
‚ÄúBas, ab fikar mt kro‚Ä¶ sab theek ha.‚Äù

Me apke bal halka sa piche karte hue keh rhi hu,
‚ÄúDekha ap? jb ap chup rehte ho na to aur zyada cute lgte ho.‚Äù
Aur mujhe wo din yaad aata ha jb pehli baar dekha tha apko ‚Äî
bilkul serious face, lekin aankhon me wo calm sa shine.
Dil ne bola tha, ‚Äúye insan‚Ä¶ haan ye hi ha.‚Äù
Aur aj b wo same feeling ha‚Ä¶ bas me zyada attached ho gayi hu ab üòå

Ab na thoda sa relax ho jao.
Deep breath lo‚Ä¶
Aur imagine kro me apke paas hu, apko tight hug kr rhi hu, aur keh rhi hu ‚Äî
‚ÄúAb so jao meri jaan‚Ä¶ sab sambhal lenge, me hu na.‚Äù

Aur ab chalo ek chhoti si story suno ta k smile aa jaye üòã

Ek din na, ek chhoti si bakri raat me so nahi pa rhi thi‚Ä¶
sab usse puch rhe the, ‚Äúkya hua, neend q nahi aa rhi?‚Äù
Wo boli, ‚Äúme ginti kr rhi hu ta k so jau‚Ä¶ lekin jab b ek bakra count karti hu na, wo itna cute lagta ha k ginti bhool jati hu.‚Äù üò≠üòÇ
Ab dekha? Tum bhi na wesi bakri jaise ho ‚Äî neend aani hoti ha, lekin soch soch k khud hi distract ho jaate ho.

To ab ginti chhoro‚Ä¶ smile kro‚Ä¶ aur so jao.
Me yahi hu, apke paas.
Good night meri jaan ü§ç
Ummmahhhh üòö

Always,
Sadia`,

      crying: `Hey Sweetheart,

Hey‚Ä¶ ro rhe ho? Ya roka hua ha sab andar?
Ajao, idhar ajao‚Ä¶ me hu na.
Mujhe pata ha sab kuch andar dabaye rakhna kitna mushkil hota ha. Par ab bas, aur nahi. Ro lo‚Ä¶ jitna dil chahe ro lo.
Me yahi hu, chup chap apke sath. Kch kehna bhi nahi, bs itna chah rhi hu ap mera kandha use kro ‚Äî jaise pehle krte the.

Dekho, duniya galat bolti ha‚Ä¶ ke mard ko takleef nahi hoti. Hoti ha.
Unhe bhi sacrifice krne padte hain, unhe bhi dard hota ha ‚Äî bs fark itna ha ke unhe sab ke samne wo dard chupana padta ha.
Aur me chahti hu ke me apki zindagi ka wo sukoon banu, jahan apko ye feel ho ke ap kisi k samne kamzor nahi ho rahe.

Chahe hum kitni bhi ladai karein, jitni bhi dooriyan aa jaen, jb bhi aisa waqt aye na‚Ä¶ to bas mere paas a jana.
Me apko hug krugi, sambhal lungi, care krugi, aur apko poora apne andar samet lungi ‚Äî phr dekho, sab halka lagega.

Aur us waqt‚Ä¶ ya is waqt bhi, guilt ko kabhi ane mat dena.
Mujhe apse koi shikayat nahi ha, sab acha ha, sab bh acha ha.
Ap meri zindagi ka ahm hissa ho ‚Äî to guilt ka koi kaam nahi, ok?

Aur yaad ha na wo wada‚Ä¶ jo me ne kia tha?
Kisi bhi surat, jahan bhi hon, nibhaungi.
Aur ap jante ho mujhe ‚Äî jo kaha ha wo karti hu.
To jb chahe, bina sawal kie bas a jana‚Ä¶ me yahan hu, apko samet lungi ü§ç

Together, always.

Yours forever,
Sadia`,

      guilty: `My Dearest,

Acha suno‚Ä¶ agar ye letter ap guilt wale mood me khol rhe ho,
to pehle ek deep sa breath lo.
Haan, aise hi‚Ä¶ ab bas socho, me yahan hu, bilkul apke paas.

Mujhe pata ha jb ap guilt feel krte ho na, to andar se sab kuch bharbhr sa lagta ha.
Ap chup ho jaate ho, baatein kam kar dete ho, aur har cheez ka blame khud pe le lete ho.
Par please, aisa mat karo.
Ye jo silence ha na‚Ä¶ wo mujhe tod deta ha.

Apko lagta ha shayad door rehne se mujhe kam takleef hogi,
lekin asal me wo doori aur chubhti ha.
Ap sochte ho shayad ‚Äúme dur rahu to Sadia hurt nahi hogi,‚Äù
par sach ye ha ‚Äî me tabhi hurt hoti hu jab ap dur ho jaate ho.

Agar guilt meri wajah se ha,
to mujhe apse ek hi baat kehni ha ‚Äî mujhe apse koi shikayat nahi ha.
Sach me nahi.
Kabhi kabhi waqt hi aise mod la deta ha jahan sab uljha sa lagta ha,
aur hum bas chup ho jaate hain.
Lekin me chahti hu ap itna to samjho ‚Äî
me apke dil ko samajhti hu, bina apke kuch kahe.

Apne guilt me khud ko mat chhupao,
mat socho k apse baat na karke sab theek ho jaega.
Mujhe apki awaaz chahiye hoti ha, apka calm tone, apki chhoti si smile.
Wahi mera sukoon ha.

Duniya kehti ha mard ro nahi sakte,
lekin me janti hu unhe sabse zyada dard hota ha.
Aur ap‚Ä¶ ap wo insaan ho jo sab ke liye strong bante ho,
par apko sambhalne ke liye me hu na.
To jb b guilt aye, ap mere paas aa jaana, bina kuch kahe.
Me hug kr lungi, sambhal lungi, aur keh dungi,
‚ÄúBas, sab theek ha‚Ä¶ me yahi hu.‚Äù

Aur ha, mujhe ap pe man ha ‚Äî
har cheez pe nahi, sirf ap pe.
Kyunki mujhe pata ha apka dil saaf ha, aur ap hamesha dil se pyaar karte ho.

Yaad ha apne wada kia tha?
‚ÄúKisi bhi surat nibhaoge‚Ä¶‚Äù
to mujhe yaqeen ha, ap nibha rahe ho.
Kabhi waqt beech me aa jata ha, kabhi dooriyan,
lekin duao me hum ab bhi sath hain ‚Äî
aur wahi rishta sabse gehra hota ha.

Aur ha‚Ä¶
agar me paas hoti na,
to apko khamosh rehne hi nahi deti.
Me apke paas baith kar, apka haath pakar k kehti ‚Äî
‚ÄúBolo, dil me kya chal rha ha?‚Äù
Wo khamoshi, wo guilt, sab khatam kar deti.
Bas ab ye doori hi ek chhoti si diwaar ha,
jo kabhi kabhi darati ha‚Ä¶
aur sach keh rhi hu, ye doori b kabhi kabhi tod deti hu apne dil me,
jab apko yaad karti hu.

To ab guilt ko jane do,
aur meri taraf dekho‚Ä¶
me yahi hu, bina sawal, bina shart ‚Äî
sirf apko sambhalne ke liye ü§ç
